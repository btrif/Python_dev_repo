                        ===     Overloading Operators       ===

Operator overloading (less commonly known as ad-hoc polymorphism) is a specific case of polymorphism
 (part of the OO nature of the language) in which some or all operators like +, = or == are treated
 as polymorphic functions and as such have different behaviors depending on the types of its arguments.

Suppose you have created a Vector class to represent two-dimensional vectors,
what happens when you use the plus operator to add them?
Most likely Python will yell at you.

You could, however, define the __add__ method in your class to perform vector addition
and then the plus operator would behave as per expectation âˆ’

Example :
'''

class Vector:
   def __init__(self, a, b):
      self.a = a
      self.b = b

   def __str__(self):
      return 'Vector (%d, %d)' % (self.a, self.b)

   def __add__(self,other):
      return Vector(self.a + other.a, self.b + other.b)

v1 = Vector( 2, 10 )
v2 = Vector( 5, -2 )
print (' v1 + v2 = ', v1 + v2)
