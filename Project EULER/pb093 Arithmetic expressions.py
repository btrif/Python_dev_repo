                                                        Arithmetic expressions      -       Problem 93
By using each of the digits from the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, exactly once, and making use of the
four arithmetic operations (+, −, *, /) and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer targets.

For example,

                                                                        8 = (4 * (1 + 3)) / 2
                                                                        14 = 4 * (3 + 1 / 2)
                                                                        19 = 4 * (2 + 3) − 1
                                                                        36 = 3 * 4 * (2 + 1)

Note that concatenations of the digits, like 12 + 34, are not allowed.

Using the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different target numbers of which 36 is the maximum,
and each of the numbers 1 to 28 can be obtained before encountering the first non-expressible number.

Find the set of four distinct digits, a < b < c < d, for which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, 1 to n,
can be obtained, giving your answer as a string: abcd.
