                        Cuboid layers     -    Problem 126

The minimum number of cubes to cover every visible face on a cuboid measuring 3 x 2 x 1 is 22.

- If we then add a second layer to this solid it would require 46 to cover every visible face,
- the third layer would require 78 cubes,
- and the fourth layer would require  118 cubes to cover every visible face.

- However, the first layer on a cuboid measuring 5 x 1 x 1 also requires 22 twenty-two cubes;
- similarly the first layer on cuboids measuring 5 x 3 x 1, 7 x 2 x 1, and 11 x 1 x 1 all contain forty-six cubes.

We shall define C(n) to represent the number of cuboids that contain n cubes in one of its layers.
So C(22) = 2, C(46) = 4, C(78) = 5, and C(118) = 8.

It turns out that 154 is the least value of n for which C(n) = 10.

Find the least value of n for which C(n) = 1000.

must use partition of a number to find cuboid shapes --> reverse engineering, complicated # 2016-02-12 - we'll solve it latero
