            Prize Strings       -       Problem 191

A particular school offers cash rewards to children with good attendance and punctuality.

If they are absent for three consecutive days or late on more than one occasion then they forfeit their prize.

During an n-day period a trinary string is formed for each child consisting of :
            L's (late),             O's (on time),          and A's (absent).

Although there are 81 trinary strings for a 4-day period that can be formed, exactly 43 strings would lead to a prize:

OOOO OOOA OOOL OOAO OOAA OOAL OOLO OOLA OAOO OAOA
OAOL OAAO OAAL OALO OALA OLOO OLOA OLAO OLAA AOOO
AOOA AOOL AOAO AOAA AOAL AOLO AOLA AAOO AAOA AAOL
AALO AALA ALOO ALOA ALAO ALAA LOOO LOOA LOAO LOAA
LAOO LAOA LAAO

How many "prize" strings exist over a 30-day period?

# I’d proceed in three steps:           #v Did not succeed
#
# First, count the strings of length 30 with two or more Ls in them.
# The non-L spots in these strings can filled any whichway.
# They can even have runs of three or more As in a row—it doesn’t matter.
#
# Second, count all of the strings with runs of As in them that also don’t have any Ls.
# So we’re just considering the length-30 strings with some mix of Os and As,
# and counting only the ones that include three or more As in a row.
#
# Finally, count all of the strings with three or more As in a row
# that also have exactly one L in them.


############## GENERAL IDEAS ################

# ===== Tue, 29 Apr 2008, 23:57, rayfil, Assembly  , Canada
# There are only 6 states in which strings can exist, divided into two groups.
# Three of those states are those where the strings don't contain any LATE occurence.
# The other three are those where the strings already contain one LATE occurence.
# Within each group, one state is when the string does not end with an absence,
# another when the string ends with only one absence, and the third when the string
# ends with two absences. Let's denote them as O, Oa, Oaa, L, La and Laa.
# Let's denote the sums of these two groups as SO and SL.
#
# The initial states after the first day would be O=1, Oa=1 and L=1(all other states =0).
# The initial sums would be SO=2 and SL=1.
# a) If absent on the following day, all strings in state Oa would become Oaa strings
#         and all strings in state O would become Oa strings.
#         Similarly, all strings in state La would become Laa strings and all strings in state L would become La strings.
# b) If late on the following day, all strings in group O would become L strings.
# c) If neither late nor absent on the following day, all strings in group O would become O strings (O=SO),
# and all strings in group L would become L strings in addition to (b) above such that L=SL+SO.
#
# The following algo should produce the answer within 1 ms with most (if not all) programming languages.
# zeycus and logopetria have already posted similar algos in their own programming language.

# === Sat, 26 Apr 2008, 15:47, logopetria, England

# After a bit of pen-and-paper work, this turns out to be nice and simple.
# Let f(n,L,A) be the number of strings of length n with L 'L's and ending in exactly A 'A's.
#
# We build up valid strings by starting with the empty string and appending either an 'A','O' or 'L' at each step.
# The prize-winning strings are those with L=0 or 1 and A=0,1, or 2.
# In moving from length-n strings to length-(n-1) strings, there are 3 cases to consider:
#
# (i) a string ending in exactly 1 'A' or 2 'A's can be made in just one way,
# by appending an 'A' to a string ending in exactly 0 or 1 'A's respectively.
#        f(n,L,1) = f(n-1,L,0) ;   f(n,L,2) = f(n-1,L,1)
#
# (ii) a string with no 'L's ending in no 'A's must end in 'O'; its prefix must contain no 'L's and can end in 0, 1 or 2 'A's.
#        f(n,0,0) = sum_{A=0..2} f(n-1,0,A)
#
# (iii) a string with 1 'L' ending in no 'A's must either end in 'O' or 'L'.
# In either case, its prefix can end with 0,1 or 2 'A's, as above.  If the string ends in 'L',
# its prefix must contain no 'L'; whereas if the string ends in 'O', its prefix must contain exactly 1 'L'.
#        f(n,1,0) = sum_{L=0..1} sum_{A=0..2) f(n-1,L,A)
# (So every prize-winning string of length n-1 can be extended to another prize-winning string in exactly 1 way.)
#
# Thus, denoting the 6 values of f(n,L,A) by:
#        [p,q,r,s,t,u] = [f(n,0,0), f(n,0,1), f(n,0,2), f(n,1,0), f(n,1,1), f(n,1,2)]
# we get the 6 values of f(n+1,L,A) by:
#        [(p+q+r), p, q, (p+q+r+s+t+u), s, t]
#
# The initial case at 0 days is clearly:
#     f(0,0,0)=1; f(0,L,A)=0 otherwise
#
# The total number of prize-winning strings of length n+1 is the sum of these 6 values;
# but the above formula shows that we can work this out just by iterating for one more day
# and returning the value of f(n,1,0).
# So the program itself is very simple and pretty quick:

# hmmm, don't even know what is DP, but i knew (math sense tingling) there is a a simple recursion on n
# (i was even hopping for closed form).
# From there on it was a matter of good google searches, to hit the Tribonaci numbers.
# Whose recursion gave me idea how to thing about the problem right (erasing the last A sequence)
# and how to expand it for that annoying L (admittedly if the Ls are more this method would not work well).
