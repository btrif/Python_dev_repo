                            Idempotents     -       Problem 407

If we calculate a**2 mod 6 for 0 ≤ a ≤ 5 we get: 0,1,4,3,4,1.

The largest value of a such that    :   a**2 ≡ a (mod 6)        is = 4.
Let's call M(n) the largest value of a < n such that            :       a**2 ≡ a (mod n).
So M(6) = 4.

Find ∑M(n) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 10**7.

# ==== GENERAL IDEAS ===========
# So our plan, in pseudocode, is:
#
# 1.      Factorize all the integers up to 10**7 by sieving.
# 2.      For each integer n:
# 3.            - if n is a prime or prime power, then a=1;
# 4.            - otherwise n is a product of two or more distinct primes, so:
# 5.      for each way to factorize n=uv with u, v coprime:
# 6.            -   find w=u**(−1) (mod v)
# 7.     a is the maximum of uw for all such uv.
#
#
# Now at step 6 we have to find the multiplicative inverse of u modulo v.
# There are a couple of algorithms for finding the modular multiplicative inverse:
# normally we would use the extended Euclidean algorithm, but here the method using Euler's theorem
# is attractive because we know that u is coprime to v.
# So u**(−1) = u**(φ(v)−1) (mod v) where φ is Euler's totient function.

# a^2 = a (mod n)
# a * (a - 1) = 0 (mod n)
# Let n = d * e with a = 0 (mod d) , (a - 1) = 0 (mod e) , and gcd(d, e) = 1
# Let a = d * w and then substitute (d * w - 1) = 0 (mod e)
# Re-write as d * w = 1 (mod e) , or w = modinv(d, e)
# Then a = d * modinv(d, e)
#
# So, check all coprime d and e with d * e = n to see which one gives the largest a.
#
# I used a sieve to compute the divisors of n , storing only divisors >= sqrt(n) and skipping 1 .
# I also realized we can use the results of the extended Euclidean algorithm for GCD three times - once to check gcd(d, e) = 1 ,
# once for modinv(d, e) , and once for modinv(e, d). This is faster than calling GCD once and modinv twice.

# Recall that based on the functional representation of the remainder operation, a**2 ≡ amod n is equivalent to
# a=a**2−⌊a**2/n⌋*n, which can be rearranged to a(a−1)/n=⌊a**2/n⌋ .
# This means n is a factor of a(a−1) where 0≤a<n, with the goal being to maximize a.
#
# Consider the M(6) example. The possible values of a(a−1) where a<n are 20, 12, 6, 2, and 0.
# The largest of these that is divisible by n=6 is 12, which corresponds to an aa value of 4.
# Thus, M(6) = 4. However, this process is quite tedious, since it requires many divisibility checks for larger values of nn.
#
# Instead, work in reverse. For each level of a, which values of n does it correspond to?
# If we were to look at the a=4 level where a(a−1) is 12, we note that it would only be the answer
# to values of n that divide 12. In other words, only the divisors of a(a−1) are relevant.
# So what I did was sieve divisors over the entire range a≤10**7.
# The divisors of a(a−1) can be constructed easily from the divisors of a and a−1.
# The combined divisors serve as the candidates for n.
#     For each resulting n, ensure that a<n and n≤10**7,
# then update the value of M(n) with the current a (which will always be maximal
# by the last time M(n) is updated since we iterate a upwards).
#
# Under 3 minutes (~160 seconds) in Python (the same code is about 20s in C++):
